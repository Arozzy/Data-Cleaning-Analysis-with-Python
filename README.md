# Data-Cleaning-with-Python

# Introduction  
This report contains the data cleaning process and analysis of census data that was generated, using the Faker Package in Python, which is like the census data conducted in a small town in the United Kingdom in 1881. The report covers some major estimates such as population distribution, occupation status, population growth and occupancy level. To calculate these estimates, some assumptions were made because the data available is only for one year, and there is need to compare different years. These assumptions will be detailed in the report. 

# Objective  
This report aims to provide an overview of the key findings and trends from the census data and give the government recommendations based on the analysis, on what to build on an unoccupied plot of land, and to identify which sector they should invest in.
